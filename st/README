Simple Templates
I've used a variation of this for many things, mostly configuration templates
per environment. I published here to make it available mostly for the Kisssme
project (https://github.com/matthewstory/kisssme)


This is designed to be very simple, just data substitution template, most
people can do this in any language in a few minutes, I probably wrote this 
same functionality in 5 languages 25 times, hopefully this will be one of 
the last times.

std can take 3 parameters, positionally:

#>std <variable definition> <template>  <output>

all are file names, or can be left blank to default to the envrionement, STDIN
and STDOUT respectively. You can also use a single '-' to force the same behaviour.

#>std - /mytemplates/template.tmpl 

will read variable data from the envrionment, read the template.tmpl file and output
to STDOUT.

enjoy.
