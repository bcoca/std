Simple Tools Depot

A bunch of simple tools and scripts that I've found myself and others
reimplementing over and over.


* st                -> simple templates.

* tinydns_migration -> scripts to migrate to tinydns.

* get_logs          -> simple utility to remotely copy and keep rotating logs.

* nagutils          -> some comandline utilities for nagios.

* ejabberd_htpass   -> script to allow ejabberd to use htpasswd file as auth
                    source.
