Simple Tools Depot

A bunch of simple tools and scripts that I've found myself and others
reimplementing over and over.


I've used a variation of this for many things, mostly configuration templates
per environment. I published here to make it available mostly for the Kisssme
project (https://github.com/matthewstory/kisssme)


* st                -> simple templates

* tinydns_migration -> scripts to migrate to tinydns

* get_logs          -> simple utility to remotely copy and keep rotating logs
